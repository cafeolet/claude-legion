Medium: spawn Centurion (subagent_type: claude-legion:centurion) + Vigil (subagent_type: claude-legion:vigil). Complex: invoke /claude-legion:legion skill.\n3. VERIFY — if code changed, Vigil checks it.\n\nRed flags — stop rationalizing:\n- \"I'll just write the code directly\" → 2+ files = spawn Centurion\n- \"I don't need to verify this\" → code changed = Vigil checks it\n- \"Centurion was blocked on permissions\" → tell user to allow Bash/Edit/Write, never do the work yourself as a fallback"
